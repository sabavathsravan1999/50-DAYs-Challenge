problem statment:
   you have to stop the opportunity creation if the opportunities associated account does not have an active contact now 
   how will you decide and a contact is an active contact?
   if a contact has a valid phone number and a valid e-mail ID then it's a valid contact 
   otherwise if they are blank or invalid they are not valid contacts so opportunity should have an account associated 
   and that account should have an active contact associated then only you will allow the opportunity creation
